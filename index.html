	<h1>Hi there, I'm Thomas!</h1>
	<p>My 10 year career in the Marine Corps has given me the opportunity to refine my leadership, 
        communication and problem solving skills in 7 different countries. My goal is to leverage my 
        experience as I transition into the public workforce. I am currently attending the University 
        of Oregon pursuing a degree in computer information sciences.  <a href="/about/about.html">More about me...</a></p>
